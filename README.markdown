# Description
This is my very green and (at least for now) very limited library of dotfiles.

In order to install it, you just...

Download it somewhere..
```
git clone git://github.com/rgeyer/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then run the bootstrap script..
```
~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```

This will make a backup copy of any dotfile that may already exist in your home directory, then symlink all the dotfiles from this collection to your home directory.

## More Descriptiveness
Did I mention I'm new to this?

Yeah so, you'll find a lot of stuff that's blatantly copied from other great dotfile projects (I'll point them out in the references below, and in comments where appropriate), as well as stuff that I completely, or partly don't understand.
